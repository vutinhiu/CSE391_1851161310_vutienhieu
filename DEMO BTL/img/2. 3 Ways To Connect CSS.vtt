00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.980
Hi there!
In this video, we will teach you how to add

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.330
CSS to HTML code. But before we get to that,
let’s talk about the general structure of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.260
CSS. It consists of several elements. Elements
that indicate WHAT to change are called CSS

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.629
properties. Each CSS property can have several
values. For example, to change the text color

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.940
you need to use the color property. Please
note that you need to use the American spelling

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.289
of “color”; the British one won’t work.
In the function of the value, we specify the

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:51.079
color. For example: blue, red, green, or yellow.
In CSS, there are more than 100 different

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.140
colors. We’ll talk about the ways to set
the color in a separate video lesson.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.710
There’s another property called font-family.
Please note, that these two words need to

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.990
be written with a hyphen. This property specifies
the font for a text. For the value we’ll

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.351
specify a font name, for example, Arial or
“Times New Roman” or something else. If

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:22.590
a font name, like “Times New Roman,” consists
of several words, it has to be written in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.539
quotes. If it consists of one word, quotes
are optional. We’ll talk about fonts in

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.150
a separate video.
Now let’s learn how to add these properties

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.070
to HTML. There are three ways to do this.
Let’s talk about each of them in turn.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.700
The first way is to write CSS directly in
the tag you want to change. You can do this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.850
with the style attribute. Then we add properties
and corresponding values using the following

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.149
form: “property, colon, then the value,
then a semicolon, then the next property,

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:04.520
colon, value, semicolon” and so on. This
method is also called the “inline method.”

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.149
For example, in HTML we have 2 &lt;p&gt; tags. On
the screen, you see how these &lt;p&gt; tags are

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.590
displayed. Say we want to change the color
of both paragraphs from black to blue. To

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.260
do this, we need to add style attribute. Therefore,
we write “style”, equal sign and then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.370
in quotes color, colon, blue and after that
semicolon.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.890
So as you see, we’ve written style attribute
and then its value, by writing “color:blue”

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.610
Now, let’s try to do it in practice. Let’s
create a &lt;p&gt; tag in the body with the text

00:02:45.610 --> 00:03:01.020
“All your dreams can come true.” Refresh
the page. And we see how it is displayed on

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.930
the web page. Now let’s make the paragraph
blue. To do this, let’s write style, equal

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.170
sign and then in quotes“color:blue” and
ending with the semicolon. And let’s set

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:25.709
for our paragraph the font-family Arial. As
you can see, our paragraph is blue and in

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.001
Arial. Again, let’s have a look. First,
we set the property color. Then colon, then

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:39.959
the value of this property: blue. Then semicolon.
And then the next property font-family, colon,

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.790
and the value of this property Arial. And
then again at the end, we have to set a semicolon.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.189
If we had one more property, we would write
this property here.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:04:07.209
Now let’s add another &lt;p&gt; tag. For example,
with the text “just do it.” As you see,

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.069
the paragraph is in black and in the default
font. And if we want to make this paragraph

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:22.230
blue and in Arial, we have to copy the whole
style attribute and paste it here. If we have

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.220
two or three &lt;p&gt; tags, this is more or less
okay. But if I had 10 &lt;p&gt; tags, it wouldn’t

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.800
be okay. Because if we needed to change the
color of all the &lt;p&gt; tags from blue to another

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.911
color, it wouldn’t be convenient, because
we would have to change each &lt;p&gt; tag, one

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:43.060
at a time.
So that’s why a second way of connecting

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.610
CSS was created. In the first way, we added
attribute style. In the second, we just add

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:00.440
a &lt;style&gt; tag. The &lt;style&gt; tag has to be written
in the &lt;head&gt; tag. It’s very, very important.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.160
As you see, I have written in the &lt;style&gt;
tag &lt;p&gt;, and then a pair of curly brackets

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.949
(as you see, the opening curly bracket and
the closing one). And then we write color,

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:18.100
colon, blue, semicolon.
Okay, let’s have a closer look at our &lt;style&gt;

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.540
tag. So in our &lt;style&gt; tag, I wrote p and
then a pair of curly brackets and the font-family,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:33.000
colon, Arial, semicolon, and then color, colon,
yellow, semicolon. The p tag is called a selector,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.300
because, among all the tags available, we’re
only selecting the p tags. And here, for example,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:49.650
color is a property and yellow is a value.
And font-family is also a property and Arial

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.960
is a value. Let’s take a look how it works
in practice.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:04.949
We have to write the &lt;style&gt; tag inside of
the &lt;head&gt; tag. In the &lt;style&gt; tag, we write

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:14.310
p, then curly brackets, and then we simply
need to copy what we did in the previous method.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.260
And we paste it here. We can leave it as it
is or we can write each property on a separate

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.020
line.
I highly recommend writing each property on

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.180
a separate line, because if we write it this
way, then it’s much easier to read the code.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.780
And as you see, each property starts already
tabbed. I highly recommend applying the same

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.290
approach. Now we can delete the &lt;p&gt; tags that
we don’t need. And for the &lt;p&gt; tags that

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:58.849
we do need, we can delete style attribute.
Now let’s see if something changes on our

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:06.139
web page. As you can see, nothing has changed.
So everything works as it worked in the first

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.319
way of CSS connecting. No matter how many
&lt;p&gt; tags we add, each &lt;p&gt; tag will be blue

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:17.280
and in Arial.
So, great. This way is much more convenient

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.180
than the last one. However, this isn’t even
the best option, since this way only works

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.540
for the page that contains the &lt;style&gt; tag.
But then websites typically contain several

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:39.660
pages. For example, index.html and contact-us.html.
To specify the same style for the &lt;p&gt; tags

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.400
for every page, we would have to copy the
whole &lt;p&gt; tag with its content and insert

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.509
it into each HTML page. And if we wanted to
change the text color in the &lt;p&gt; tag, we would

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:59.800
have to go into every HTML document and change
the color. That would be very inconvenient.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.389
That’s why there’s a third method which
allows us to add CSS with the help of a separate

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:13.900
file. Basically, you create a separate folder
called css. And then in this folder you create

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:22.770
a file called style with a css extension.
Then you connect this file to each HTML page.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.949
As a result, you only need to write the style
once in a separate file, and then it works

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:36.560
for every tag that it’s specified to affect.
The style file gets connected to the same

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.690
&lt;head&gt; tag, but in this situation, it’s
done with the help of a &lt;link&gt; tag with two

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:47.710
mandatory attributes: 1) rel with the value
stylesheet - to indicate that we’re connecting

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:55.190
styles and 2) the attribute href to specify
the file which we’re connecting to. In our

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:07.140
example, href will be the following: css/style.css.
In our CSS file, we’ll have a p tag, curly

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:14.670
brackets, and then color: blue.
Let’s see how it works in practice. First,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:30.250
let’s copy the file index.html and rename
it to contact-us.html.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:36.610
Now let’s create the folder “CSS,” in
which we will create the file style.css. So

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:42.630
let’s go to Sublime and create a new file.
Let’s save it to the “CSS” folder with

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:53.110
the name “style.css” Now you see that
our file “style.css” is open. Now we will

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.160
add the content we wrote before in the &lt;style&gt;
tag. Make sure that you don’t include the

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.070
&lt;style&gt; tag, only the content in the &lt;style&gt;
tag.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.040
Now we can delete the &lt;style&gt; tag. Let’s
connect the style.css file to our index.html

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:17.810
file. To do this, we write a &lt;link&gt; tag and
two necessary attributes: rel with the value

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:29.840
“stylesheet” and then href attribute where
we write the path to our file. And that is

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:37.000
css/style.css. Congratulations, we’ve connected
the two files.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:51.400
Now let’s open the file “contact-us.”
Here we will also delete the &lt;style&gt; tag.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:11:02.320
And we will change this content to, for example,
&lt;h1&gt; with the text “Contact Us.” And here

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:23.511
we also connect the CSS file to this page.
Okay, done. Refresh our index.html page. And

00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:31.600
we see that everything works.
Now let’s open the contact-us html file.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.880
And we see that the text “Contact Us”
is bold and in black. Why? Because right now,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:47.480
we have styles only for p tags. So if we also
want a color to h1, what do we need to do?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:55.690
We have to write in the style.css file “h1”
(and that means we are selecting all h1’s),

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:04.920
then curly brackets, then color, for example,
red. Save it. And refresh the page. As you

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.860
see, h1 is red, while all the paragraphs are
blue. So everything works.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:18.500
To sum things up, if you want to give styles
to one tag, you should use the style attribute.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.750
If you want to give styles to a page, you
should use the &lt;style&gt; tag. And if you want

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:30.600
to give styles to many pages, not just one,
you have to create a separate style.css file

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.310
with all the styles in it and then connect
it to the HTML files with the help of a &lt;link&gt;

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:43.730
tag. It’s best to use the third way, since
it allows us to set styles for separate tags,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.600
one page, or many pages and therefore it covers
everything we need.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.180
So that’s all for this lesson. See you in
the next one.
